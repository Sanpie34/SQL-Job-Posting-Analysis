# Data-Analyst-or-Data-Scientist-Portfolio
This repository is for a CV/LinkedIn Portfolio. This repository will contain project portfolios of Python, SQL, Excel and Power BI.

## Welcome to my Repository
The purpose of this repository is to share my portfolio for applying work (CV/Resume/LinkedIn). This repository also acts as a storage and backup.

## Disclaimer
This project uses Luke Barousse [Datanerd](https://datanerd.tech/) datasets. This project analysis approach was inspired by Luke Barousse's YouTube course.
